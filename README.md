## Group Work
### Question 1: Produce an initial interface Log-in in Python. (15 Marks)

Produce an initial opening interface for your system, it should allow a user to log into the system. Depending on the user who logs in, it should display different information/options which represent the functionality offered to that type of user. Use of HCI and layout are considered. Note: you are expected to include a level of customisation which will allow the user to make changes to font colours, size etc., this could be accessible via menu bar.

### Question 4: Write a user guide describing how the software should be used. (25 Marks)

There should be differentiation or acknowledgement of the different roles of users (unregistered user, registered user, police, council members, etc.) and screenshots or diagrams are permitted.
This is intended to instruct users in how to use the system. It should take them through logging onto the system and include what they should see depending on their access level, it would also be useful to include ‘trouble shooting’ what will they see for example if they enter the incorrect login details.
