1,1,Any thoughts on how the council's handling bike thief?,"Hey everyone,

I've been cycling around Gateshead for a few years now and have noticed an increase in bike thefts recently. I've had two friends who‚Äôve had their bikes stolen this year alone. I'm wondering what everyone thinks about how the council is dealing with this issue. Are they doing enough? Could they improve their approach? Any suggestions on what we, as a community, can do to help?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",,2024-05-27 03:16:26.016879,5,1,0

I totally agree with you. It feels like bike theft is getting out of control. I think the council should invest more in secure bike parking and maybe increase patrols in hotspots. Also, it would be great if they could set up more surveillance cameras in key areas.",1,2024-05-27 03:28:33.834608,0,0,0
4,1,Comment by standarduser to thread: Any thoughts on how the council's handling bike thief?,"Good point, Liam. I also think the council could work more closely with the police. More coordinated efforts might help track down these thieves and deter them from targeting our community. Reporting tools on platforms like this one could also be more actively monitored and responded to.",1,2024-05-27 03:30:53.097486,0,0,0
5,1,Comment by standarduser to thread: Best and Worst Bike Parking Spots in Gateshead?,"For the best parking spots, I'd recommend the bike racks near Gateshead Interchange. They're well-lit, usually have available spaces, and are covered. On the downside, avoid parking near the Trinity Square area. I've heard a few reports of theft there, and the racks are often overcrowded.",2,2024-05-27 03:34:42.382601,0,0,0

13,1,Comment by standarduser to thread: Reporting Bike Theft in Gateshead - How Effective is It?,"Thanks for starting this thread. As a standard user, I wanted to share my perspective. I reported a case of bike vandalism a few months ago. The response from the police was pretty quick‚Äîthey got back to me within a day. However, I didn‚Äôt hear much afterward, and there wasn't a follow-up to inform me of any actions taken or any increase in patrols.

However, let's keep pushing for these improvements. I believe our collective efforts can make a significant difference.",11,2024-05-27 04:02:58.966704,0,0,0

After my bike got swiped, I reached out to them about checking the CCTV footage in the area. You know what I got? Radio silence. Not a single response. How can they be so ignorant?

I get it, my bike wasn't locked up like Fort Knox, but that doesn't excuse their lack of action. We pay taxes for these services, right? So why are they so quick to ignore us when we need help?

It's not just about my bike‚Äîit's about holding our local authorities accountable. We deserve better than this. Has anyone else experienced a similar run-around from the council?",,2024-05-27 04:24:02.587760,1,4,3
